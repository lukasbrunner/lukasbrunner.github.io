While the warming of the climate system through the emission of man-made greenhouse gases is clear from observations, models, and our understanding of the climate system, projections of the future climate face a range of uncertainties. In the following I'm going to introduce the three most important sources of uncertainty and how my research can help to reduce them.

**Internal variability** stems from the fact that the Earth's climate
is an extremely complex and chaotic system. The animation below shows
global mean temperature for the years 1900 to 2005 from one selected
climate model. Ignoring a possible trend for now, the (seemingly
random) fluctuations are referred to as internal variability and
constitute one important source of uncertainty. In fact, internal
variability cannot really be reduced since it is part of the climate
system (however, one could potentially select temporal and spatial
scales with lower natural variability &ndash; more about that later)

**Scenario uncertainty** arises because climate scientists can't
make predictions about decisions taken by politics and society. Will
we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we did in the past? Or will
we manage to reach the goals set by the <a target="_blank"                                                    href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement">
Paris Agreement</a>, hence limiting global warming to well below
2&#176;C? In order to be able to make statements about the future
climate we use projections based on different paths our society
(read: our emissions) might take. The animation below shows the
possible development of global mean temperature between 2006 and 2100
based on three such assumptions.

**Model uncertainty** accounts for the fact that climate models
can never completely reproduce reality (I've already mentioned that
the climate system is extremely complex). Models therefore use
approximations to represent certain processes. Different models use
different approximations and therefore yield slightly different
results. The animation below consecutively adds more models for each
of the three scenarios, resulting in a representation of uncertainty
due to imperfect modelling.

**Wrap-up:** I introduced the three main sources of
uncertainty we face when predicting Earth's future climate. The
animation below puts it all together and shows the relative
contributions from each of the three sources to the total
uncertainty. As can be seen, the contributions are not constant over
time. For the near future internal variability still plays an
important role. Model uncertainty is most important on an
intermediate time scale, while predictions for the end of the
century are dominated by the scenario uncertainty.

Based on data from the ETH CMIP-5 archive. Figure 1 shows
historical annual mean, global mean temperature anomalies
from the CNRM-CM5 model. Figure 2 additionally shows the RCPs
2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Figure 3 shows up to 28 models. Figure 4 shows
the CNRM-CM5 model as a
representation for internal variability, the standard
deviation from the multi-model mean as a representation for
model uncertainty, and the three RCPs as a representation for
scenario uncertainty. The small figure inside figure 4 shows
the relative contributions from the three sources of
uncertainty based on a method proposed by Hawkins and Sutton
