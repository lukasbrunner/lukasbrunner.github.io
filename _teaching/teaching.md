Supervision
-----------

I am happy to supervise bachelor and master theses on topics related to
- temperature extremes and their drivers,
- atmospheric blocking and connected extremes,
- statistical climate model evaluation and comparison,
- future climate model projections and their uncertainties and,
- machine learning for climate sciences.

If you consider writing a thesis with me please have a look at <a href="/thesis/supervision_approach.pdf" target="_blank"><b>**my supervision approach (PDF)**</b></a>. Feel free to reach out anytime to discuss potential topics or if you have any questions.

### Open topics

See <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FBDPml7f29JS2rWBBFakq-Hdv_8iEz1b4m1onsod26o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a> for a list of open topics and a short description.

### Ongoing supervision

- Work on explainable machine learning to separate climate models and observations (master's thesis)
- Work on changes in cooling and heating degree days in Canada under climate change (master's thesis)

### Scientific writing guide for students

Since I see many of my students struggling with similar things when writing their thesis, I've started to compile a document with some guidelines for scientific writing. It draws on my own experience as well as on several other grey literature sources (e.g.,
<a href="https://www.kuwi.europa-uni.de/en/lehrstuhl/vs/politik-JP/Hinweise-fuer-Studierende/index.html"  target="_blank">here</a>,
<a href="https://klimadynamik.univie.ac.at/?page_id=14"  target="_blank">here</a>, and
<a href="https://x.com/cesifoti/status/1773388661893017897"  target="_blank">here</a>
).
The guide is by no means comprehensive or finished but I provide it here in the hope it might be helpful to some. If you have any feedback or suggestions for changes or additions feel free to reach out.
