Supervision
-----------

I am happy to supervise bachelor and master theses on
- temperature extremes,
- atmospheric blocking,
- future climate model projections and their uncertainties and,
- machine learning for climate sciences,
- any related topics (reach you to discuss).

If you consider writing a thesis with me please have a look at **[my supervision approach (PDF)](/thesis/supervision.pdf)**. Feel free to reach out anytime to discuss potential topics or if you have any questions.


### Scientific writing

Since I see many of my students struggling with similar things when writing their thesis, I've started to compile a document with some guidelines for scientific writing. It draws on my own experience as well as on several other grey literature sources (e.g.,
<a href="https://www.kuwi.europa-uni.de/en/lehrstuhl/vs/politik-JP/Hinweise-fuer-Studierende/index.html"  target="_blank">here</a>,
<a href="https://klimadynamik.univie.ac.at/?page_id=14"  target="_blank">here</a>, and
<a href="https://x.com/cesifoti/status/1773388661893017897"  target="_blank">here</a>
).
The guide is by no means comprehensive or finished but I provide it here in the hope it might be helpful to some. If you have any feedback or suggestions for changes or additions feel free to reach out.
