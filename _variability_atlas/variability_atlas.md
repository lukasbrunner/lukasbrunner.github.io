The _Variability Atlas_ provides a toolbox to investigate the effects of internal climate variability on different climate extremes. It is introduced and decribed in the accompanying publication from Brunner et al. (submitted; TODO: add link on final publication).

Depending on your use-case and level of expertise you can chose from three layers of complexity:
- online tool with graphical user interface (no programming expertise necessary): [Shiny App](https://019bbc84-e87b-2fef-8974-9e37125a2551.share.connect.posit.cloud/)
- GitHub repository providing example Jupyter notebooks based on pre-calculated data (basic experience in Python needed): [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lukasbrunner/etccdi_internal_variability)
- GitHub repository drawing on the raw data hosted at the WDCC (advanced experience to handle and process large data volumes required): TODO: data DOI
